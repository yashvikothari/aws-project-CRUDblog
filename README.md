# Project Scenario

A fast-paced startup company named Platform has decided to build their own micro-blogging platform crUDr and has hired its first cloud engineer.

Company paid a web-development firm to translate their wireframe designs into sample mock web-application so they could show it to potential investors and gather funds.

After a successful round of funding, cloud engineer have been tasked with taking the mock web-application and making it production ready at scale.

The startup company consulted a fractional CTO to help choose some of the technical requirements to get company on a good technical roadmap:

(About him, He provides strategic tech guidance, leadership, and expertise for a fraction of the time,while working for multiple projects and companies.

Usually smaller businesses that might not have the resources without full-time commitment or cost can benifit and leverage his expertise
)

The frontend application should be written in Javascript using React (functional components).

for UI using reusable component defined using plain Javascript function
instead of  being based on class. They can recieve props & return React Element React 16.8 introduced hooks,which let you use state & other React features without writing a class.

With Hooks, functional components have become more powerful and can do almost everything that class components can.

Imagine you have a toy factory. 

In this factory, there are two ways to make toys:

The Old Way (Class-based): a big, complicated machine. 
It can make toys with lot of buttons, levers, and parts. 
It's powerful, & becomes confusing to use.

The New Way (Functional): a simpler, smaller machine. 
At first, it could only make basic toys. 

But then, the factory introduced a magical tool kit called "Hooks". 

With these "Hooks", the smaller machine could suddenly do almost everything the big machine could do, but in a simpler way.

So, in our toy-making world:

Toys are like the things you see on a website (like buttons, text, images).

Props are like the instructions you give to the machine on what kind of toy to make.

Hooks are the magical tools that make the small machine super powerful.

React introduced a simpler way (functional components) to make the same beautiful toys (website parts) with the help of a magical tool kit (Hooks).

React Functional Components Breakdown:-

1. Button Component

2. User Profile

3. Todo List Item

4. Theme Toggler

5. Search Input (demonstration useEffect hook)

6. Counter (with state using Hooks)
---------------------------------------------

The backend application should be written in Python using Flask

1.API only

2.choose a popular framework API only framework

3.a micro-framework is required because company is offloading as much to the cloud as possible to avoid be a monolithic application

4.no ORM because the CTO considers it an anti-pattern

5.Considering Python for cloud programming language.

6.That an API specification be defined detailing the exact endpoints required.

7.The web application:

- Shall be deployed to AWS.
- Takes advantage of modern-applications cloud services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The startup company has spent the majority of their funding on hiring Cloud Engineers for the next 6 months (but in reality have spent the money on marketing and buying a really cool domain) and so try to keep the cloud provider costs as low as possible.

Good Luck! ðŸ˜‚
